                        “The need to act is clear. Entrepreneurs have the power to create jobs and drive growth –
                        but first we need to give them the tools and the environment that will enable them to
                        succeed.”

                        The demand to become entrepreneur is already know and widely accepted by the society, especially when it comes to developing countries with no population control it’s become urgency to develop & nurture potential Entrepreneurs, Technopreneur and Startups.

                        <br />   
                        The journey from Startup to Public ltd. company is not overnight task. Many people drop the idea to become Entrepreneur or didn’t start the venture due to associated risk.
